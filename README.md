### 🥬 A Bit About Me

I’m 22 and work as a Platform Engineer at SAP. Most of my time goes into building and maintaining cloud infrastructure and working with integration adapters. I spend a lot of time around Kubernetes clusters and containerized apps. When it all works, I pretend it was intentional.

---

### 💻 What I Actually Do

**Work stuff:**
- Keeping Kubernetes, Helm, and Docker deployments alive (or reviving them when they die)
- Writing/maintaining adapters for REST, SOAP, AXIS, SEC
- Designing cloud solutions that hopefully scale instead of explode
- Tooling and platform engineering to make life easier for the teams around me

**Not work stuff:**
- Gaming (Hearthstone + Project Moon titles are my weakness)
- Experimenting with random tech ideas that never leave the folder called `test_v3_final_FINAL_really_final`

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Tech I Use

**Infra / Cloud:** Kubernetes • Helm • Docker • SAP Cloud Platform  
**Adapters / Protocols:** REST • SOAP • AXIS • SEC  
**Languages:** Java • Python • YAML (way too much) • Bash (when things get desperate)
