## 🎨 About Me

Hey! I'm a 22-year-old Platform Engineer at SAP, specializing in cloud infrastructure and integration adapters. I work with Kubernetes, Helm, Docker, and manage REST, SOAP, AXIS, and SEC adapters. When I'm not building scalable systems, you'll find me enjoying a good cup of coffee and getting lost in Project Moon games, Pokémon, or Hearthstone!
